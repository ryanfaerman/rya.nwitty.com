Announced and shared a few weeks ago, [24 words](http://24words.com) is a digital, shareable version of the classic Bingo and I figured now would be as good a time as any to give it a quick writeup since this is the first real project I'm sharing that isn't just a backend tool for developers.

By the way, all the code has been released on bitbucket [https://bitbucket.org/ryanfaerman/word-bingo](https://bitbucket.org/ryanfaerman/word-bingo). Download it, play with it, and by all means, hack it to pieces. I won't even begin to pretend it is "secure" but seeing as it's only a bingo game, security doesn't much matter here.
