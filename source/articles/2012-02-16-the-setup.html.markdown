![The Spring 2012 Setup](http://www.ryanfaerman.com/assets/img/the_setup_2012.jpg )

## The Hardware

I'm rocking a 2011 15" Macbook Pro on a [stand](http://store.griffintechnology.com/desktop/elevator) with the Apple Thunderbolt Display. I just added a [Hoverbar](http://twelvesouth.com/products/hoverbar/) which holds my iPad out to the side; I think it'll be useful, but we'll see.

My microphone is off to the side on a desk mounted arm that swings into place when I'm ready to record screencasts or do anything else that requires audio. It's a little extravagent but I like it.

For a phone, just like the rest of the setup, I'm Apple all the way. I have a 16GB  iPhone 4. I've considered jailbreaking it, but it does everything I need it to do.


## My Ideal Setup

I'm pretty happy with my setup, the only thing I would consider changing is maybe going to a Macbook Air the next time around and potentially a pair of decent audio monitors. The speakers on the Thunderbolt Display are a bit tinny for my taste.
