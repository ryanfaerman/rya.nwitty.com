Thanks to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and [Jekyll S3](https://github.com/ebello/Jekyll-S3) this site is hosted entirely on [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/). All assets are served using Cloudfront - Amazon's CDN that serves directly from S3.

The design was made entirely by myself and should would on most browsers and operating systems. I haven't completed extensive testing but it should work. I've made no attempt for anything to work in Internet Explorer, but it should work in recent versions of that horrible browser.

As I find plugins or adjust my Rakefile, I'll be updating my github project: [jekyll launch](https://github.com/ryanfaerman/jekyll-launch). My jekyll-launch is the base I intend to use for any other jekyll-based project. Feel free to fork it and send me pull requests.
