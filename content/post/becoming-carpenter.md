When my wife and I were looking for our first home, she joked with our realtor, "I'm looking for a house, my husband is just looking for a garage". While not entirely true, it definitely had a source in truth. I grew up helping my Dad in the garage shop and I even had my own work bench that I never could keep organized.

I've always felt that a home has two hearts{{% sidenote %}}Just like a Timelord{{% /sidenote %}}: the kitchen and the garage. When we bought our home, one of the first things I did was turn the garage into my shop. I started collecting tools for both home repair and to start building things from wood.

As a developer, I've learned to be pragmatic in regards to my skillset. Before having my own shop, I never really had a constant opportunity to practice woodcraft. I had built a few of my desks{{% sidenote %}}From scratch, not from Ikea. <br/> One of my later desks was actually good enough to give to my Sister when she needed a table.{{% /sidenote %}} and a bookshelf or two, but nothing created at the quality level I wanted. I knew then that I could do better.

Mother's day was only a few weeks after we moved into our home, we were having a family brunch and we needed a table for the patio.

Still feeling bruised from making the down payment, I threw together a rough table from some wood I reclaimed{{% sidenote %}}I even reused most of the screws too! How's that for recycling?{{% /sidenote %}} from a rickety shelving unit that came with the house.

Despite being thrown together one evening after work in the week before the party, the table served us well for several years and many patio meals.

I was never truly satisfied with the quick and dirty table. The joinery was rough, the edges were harsh, and it always required a table cloth to cover its less than beautiful tabletop.

Every year in the fall, we celebrate [Succot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukkot) by building a Succah.{{% sidenote %}}My Dad and I always put lots of thought into our Succah. Sometimes even planning it right after Passover, roughly six months beforehand.<br/><br/>It's like an excuse to build a fort every year.{{% /sidenote %}} I tend to use regular 2x4s and then, after the holiday, I end up with a pile of lumber begging for a project.

The first year, I used the lumber to create a pair of wooden patio swings. These are still hanging in our patio and are one of my favorite places to take a nap. I modified some simple plans I found and banged them out pretty quick.

The second year, I stepped up my game when I ditched the Ikea table I was using as a desk and made a new one built into my closet. I hadn't really learned how to joint boards together properly so I focused on how to get a really nice lacquer finish. The desk won't win any awards, but I'm pleased with how it turned out.

With the finishing skills from the desk, a recently purchased planer, and another piece of disposable Ikea furniture to replace, I had my next project -- a new end table. This was the first project that I consider actual furniture.

It's nothing fancy.

Just a simple table with simple angles. But it proved to me that I could actually make something nice.

I continued making random things. I made a few dice, a shelf, a couple frames. But I wanted something bigger. I wanted to make a full table. With summer coming to a close, and coming off a high of binge-watching some Wood Whisperer{{% sidenote %}}[The Wood Whisperer](http://www.thewoodwhisperer.com) has lots of great content. With most of his videos, even though I haven't made what he has, he makes it seem attainable.{{% /sidenote %}} videos, I decided that I was going to make a cedar table{{% sidenote %}}Specifically, the [Rustic Outdoor Table](http://www.thewoodwhisperer.com/videos/the-not-so-rustic-rustic-outdoor-table/) from The Wood Whisperer.{{% /sidenote %}} for the patio.

With Succos being just a couple months away, I gave myself a deadline. The first use of the table would be in our Succah.

The first trip to Home Depot{{% sidenote %}}I know there are better and cheaper ways to get lumber, but I can't usually get to the one or two lumber yards in the county. They have strange hours and I wasn't going to take a day from work just to make the trip.{{% /sidenote %}} for rough cedar proved to be a challenge -- they didn't have enough in the dimensions I wanted that also was in the required quality. I ended up going to a few different stores throughout the project to get everything and I had to modify the plans slightly to compensate for the lumber I could get.

With the lumber purchased and taking up precious space in the garage, I got to work.

Each night, after my daughter went to sleep, I'd change into my overalls and spend a few hours in the garage. Each night I'd make a little progress milling and preparing the pieces for a sub-assembly. I'd put these assemblies aside to work on the next piece.

On each Sunday, after my daughter's swimming lessons and after some family time, I'd spent 6 or 8 hours in the garage. These days let me make large strides, completing tasks like jointing the boards for the tabletop or leveling the tabletop and benches.

This continued for about three weeks and in the end, I had a completed table, delivered on time. I'd enjoyed every minute of the project and in the end, I created a piece of furniture that will last a lifetime.

After Succos, I dragged the old table out to the street corner. Within a few hours I got a knock on the door. A man wanted to take the table and to make sure I was really throwing it away. Things with a purpose tend to survive, even when we don't intend them to.

With the patio cleared, my Dad helped me move the new table and benches to the patio where they have been serving us well.

We use the table frequently -- breakfast on weekends and other meals when it's cool enough. It feels like we use it more than the previous table. I'm not sure if that's because of its novelty or because it's a table that works better for us.

It's a source of pride too. I've had many people ask me where I bought it; when they find out I made it they are amazed. I didn't make it to get compliments, but that's a nice bonus.

So far, I've used most of the lumber from Succos to make toys. I've made a handful of wooden cars for my daughter and a set of giant jenga set for us. There are a few boards left that aren't earmarked for anything in particular.

I'm sure I'll find a use for them.
